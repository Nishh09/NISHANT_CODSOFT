Java Programming Projects Showcase
Welcome to my Java Programming Projects Showcase! Here, I present a collection of projects I've developed to demonstrate my skills in Java programming. Each project showcases different aspects of Java programming, ranging from game development to application interfaces and database management.

About Me
I am passionate about software development and continuously strive to improve my skills by working on various projects. Java is one of my favorite programming languages, and I enjoy creating practical and innovative solutions using its powerful features.

Project Highlights
1. Number Game
A fun guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.
Features include random number generation, user input, feedback on guesses, and score tracking.
2. Student Grade Calculator
A utility for calculating students' grades based on their marks obtained in different subjects.
